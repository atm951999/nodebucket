        Nodebucket came into being when a group of developers who were working together on a project wanted a ToDo list that made it easy to add and remove tasks as needed. They wanted the list it to be on all of their computers so that each individual could view it whenever they wanted. The list not only had to be accessible but also enable all of them to have the ability to quickly and easily add or remove a task. One of the developers started tinkering with the list and soon had two columns on a webpage that were titled: ToDo and Done. He showed the rest of the group and the others started suggesting additional features to add to the design. It was agreed that they required a button to create a new task in the ToDo list. Almost simultaneously, everyone realized that they also needed to be able to drag tasks from the ToDo list to the Done list. With these features added, Nodebucket was born. Over several weeks the developers modified and tweaked the list until it was optimized to their exact specifications.

        One day, when this group of developers were discussing how much easier their projects had become since employing nodebucket lists, it became apparent to them that others would find the list helpful in many other situations. As a result of that conversation, the developers decided to make their list public for all to use. They put their application on a server and created a website. Their stated goal: To organize the world one list at a time!
